# Overview

I developed some basic examples of how the Rust programming language works.
* Variables (mutable and unumutable)

* Expressions

* Conditionals

* Loops

* Functions (ownership or reference)

I wrote some examples of using mutable and immutable variables, expressions, conditionals, and loops. All this by calling functions created for each part respectively.

# Development Environment
* The Rust language with its dependencies.
* Visual Studio Code.
* C++ Build Tools


# Useful Websites

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)


# Future Work

* Create a program in Rust as a server.
* Create an API
